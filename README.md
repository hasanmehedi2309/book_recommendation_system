**Description & Filtering Process**
The Book Recommender System developed employs Collaborative Filtering, a technique widely used for recommendation systems. However, it adopts a unique approach by focusing only on users who have reviewed 50 or more books, thereby prioritizing knowledgeable users. This strategy enhances the quality of recommendations by leveraging insights from experienced and active readers.

**Limitations**

One notable limitation of the system is its letter sensitivity. The system relies on exact book name matches from the dataset, which may lead to challenges in cases where book titles vary slightly due to formatting inconsistencies or typographical errors. Despite this limitation, the system provides valuable recommendations based on a curated dataset of knowledgeable users.
